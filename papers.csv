"In this paper, a robust 3D triangular mesh watermarking algorithm based on 3D segmentation is proposed. In this algorithm three classes of watermarking are combined. First, we segment the original image to many different regions. Then we mark every type of region with the corresponding algorithm based on their curvature value. The experiments show that our watermarking is robust against numerous attacks including RST transformations, smoothing, additive random noise, cropping, simplification and remeshing.","['S.

"We studied an autoassociative neural network with dynamic synapses which include a facilitating mechanism. We have developed a general mean-field framework to study the relevance of the different parameters defining the dynamics of the synapses and their influence on the collective properties of the network. Depending on these parameters, the network shows different types of behaviour including a retrieval phase, an oscillatory regime, and a non-retrieval phase. In the oscillatory phase, the network activity continously jumps between the stored patterns. Compared with other activity-dependent mechanisms such as synaptic depression, synaptic facilitation enhances the network ability to switch among the stored patterns and, therefore, its adaptation to external stimuli. A detailed analysis of our system reflects an efficient-more rapid and with lesser errors-network access to the stored information with stronger facilitation. We also present a set of Monte Carlo simulations confirming our analytical results.","['JoaquÃ­n J. Torres', 'JesÃºs M. CortÃ©s', 'JoaquÃ­n Marro', 'Hilbert J.

"It is well-known that Sturmian sequences are the non ultimately periodic sequences that are balanced over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also characterized by their complexity: they have exactly $(n+1)$ distinct factors of length $n$. A natural generalization of Sturmian sequences is the set of infinite episturmian sequences. These sequences are not necessarily balanced over a $k$-letter alphabet, nor are they necessarily aperiodic. In this paper, we characterize balanced episturmian sequences, periodic or not, and prove Fraenkel's conjecture for the special case of episturmian sequences. It appears that balanced episturmian sequences are all ultimately periodic and they can be classified in 3 families.","['Genevi eve Paquin', 'Laurent Vuillon']",50,"['1c655ee2-067d-4bc4-b8cc-bc779e9a7f10', '2e4e57ca-d190-4bc7-b7ad-2e33aca2f574', '508ea83a-035b-4542-a315-9247c172d255', '666a65af-8657-43f6-b765-f2b72a16726a', '8100bfb7-3f6a-4269-bba8-7c4a6a578570', '8e035cc6-d692-4532-bb3c-a6a34b4db83a', 'e10a00d9-bb59-4f19-8f1c-85917bc03b5f']",A characterization of balanced episturmian sequences,Electronic Journal of Combinatorics,2007,4ab3a4cf-1d96-4ce5-ab6f-b3e19fc260de
"One of the fundamental challenges of recognizing actions is accounting for the variability that arises when arbitrary cameras capture humans performing actions. In this paper, we explicitly identify three important sources of variability: (1) viewpoint, (2) execution rate, and (3) anthropometry of actors, and propose a model of human actions that allows us to investigate all three. Our hypothesis is that the variability associated with the execution of an action can be closely approximated by a linear combination of action bases in joint spatio-temporal space. We demonstrate that such a model bounds the rank of a matrix of image measurements and that this bound can be used to achieve recognition of actions based only on imaged data. A test employing principal angles between subspaces that is robust to statistical fluctuations in measurement data is presented to find the membership of an instance of an action. The algorithm is applied to recognize several actions, and promising results have been obtained.","['Yaser Sheikh', 'Mumtaz Sheikh', 'Mubarak Shah']",221,"['056116c1-9e7a-4f9b-a918-44eb199e67d6', '05ac52a1-dfa2-4c32-9a54-6c1e58cfcca5', '0b2f71cc-6797-445a-82df-5be29945c0a7', '60cf9842-c3aa-463d-a5cf-17fbb8f99ccd', '7a3bb575-8313-4e77-a008-ee5cde444746', '7eda9b91-21f1-490f-8ef2-f94e81c558a4', '905461e4-643b-4da0-a669-f52318b9e126', 'be336575-9974-411d-b637-45440213cbd4', 'be9527aa-97e2-4951-86d1-cc6130cbb777', 'f0d57def-3340-49be-a1c3-cbc996af8dec']",Exploring the space of a human action,international conference on computer vision,2005,4ab3a98c-3620-47ec-b578-884ecf4a6206

"Queueing networks with multiple classes of customers play a fundamental role for evaluating the performance of both software and hardware architectures. The main strength of productâ€“form models, in particular of BCMP queueing networks, is that they combine a flexible formalism with efficient analysis techniques and solution algorithms. In this paper we provide an algorithm that starting from a highâ€“level description of a system, and from the definition of its components in terms of interacting subâ€“systems, computes a multipleâ€“class and multipleâ€“chain BCMP queueing network. We believe that the strength of this approach is twofold. First, the modeller deals with simplified models, which are defined in a modular and hierarchical way. Hence, we can carry on sensitivity analysis that may easily include structural changes (and not only on the time parameters). Second, maintaining the productâ€“form property allows one to derive the average system performance indices very efficiently. The paper also discusses the ...","['Simonetta Balsamo', 'Gianâ€“Luca Dei Rossi', 'Andrea Marin']",6,"['1c26e228-57d2-4b2c-b0c9-8d5851c17fac', '75399207-1568-4ee7-ba52-ef10f26add66', '85244323-5e23-4e8b-86f5-7ac94efeb41a', '8feb6edc-fb79-42ef-8b1f-0bdad35d32d6', 'af481f6f-28ed-450b-97ab-90053e681184', 'db568ebb-0611-468b-81cc-c1443de40c14', 'fd0827cd-5709-4048-94fd-572968165b1e']",Applying BCMP multi-class queueing networks for the performance evaluation of hierarchical and modular software systems,International Journal of Computer Aided Engineering and Technology,2015,4ab3e768-78c9-4497-8b8e-9e934cb5f2e4
"A CMOS oscillator employing differential transistor pairs working in Class-C in push-pull configuration is presented. The oscillator exhibits the same advantages enjoyed by complementary topologies on oscillators based on a single differential pair, while yielding a substantial power consumption reduction thanks to the Class-C operation. The phase-noise performance and the fundamental conditions required to keep the transistors working in Class-C are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, for an optimal performance, both nMOS and pMOS transistors should not be pushed into the deep triode region by the instantaneous resonator voltage, and a simple circuit solution is proposed to accommodate a large oscillation swing. A 0.18- Î¼m CMOS prototype of the (voltage-controlled) oscillator displays an oscillation frequency from 6.09 to 7.50 GHz. The phase noise at 2-MHz offset is below -120 dBc/Hz with a power dissipation of 2.2 mW, for a state-of-the-art figure-of-merit ranging from 189 to 191 dBc/Hz.","['Andrea Mazzanti', 'Pietro Andreani']",50,"['0a09db01-264a-4bdf-942c-d33cceb35d3c', '36c942df-7fcb-40b8-b023-a3a4001f632e', '84c00b06-a611-4082-89f7-df2d5540d210', 'a5496509-ebaf-472b-bc83-2e7c503e55bf', 'b8b564ca-0651-4fd4-8db0-0f7710e25ce1', 'bb1ed638-e3c3-46f7-adf9-6977afca564a', 'e3a35338-4747-46f7-b752-5690a5c3c84a', 'f277b0e7-3f23-4a22-ac17-fc6c6019c664']",A Pushâ€“Pull Class-C CMOS VCO,IEEE Journal of Solid-state Circuits,2013,4ab3f7cd-140b-4e29-99d4-f4e8006c4f65
"In statistical setting of the pattern recognition problem the number of examples required to approximate an unknown labelling function is linear in the VC dimension of the target learning class. In this work we consider the question whether such bounds exist if consider only computable pattern recognition methods, assuming that the unknown labelling function is also computable. We find that in this case the number of examples required for a computable method to approximate the labelling function not only is not linear, but grows faster (in the VC dimension of the class) than any computable function. No time or space constraints are put on the predictors or target functions; the only resource we consider is the training examples.#R##N##R##N#The task of pattern recognition is considered in conjunction with another learning problem â€” data compression.

"In 1999, Iwan Duursma defined the zeta function for a linear code as a generating function of its Hamming weight enumerator. It can also be defined for other homogeneous polynomials not corresponding to existing codes. If the homogeneous polynomial is invariant under the MacWilliams transform, then its zeta function satisfies a functional equation and we can formulate an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis. As far as existing codes are concerned, the Riemann hypothesis is believed to be closely related to the extremal property. In this article, we show there are abundant polynomials invariant by the MacWilliams transform which satisfy the Riemann hypothesis. The proof is carried out by explicit construction of such polynomials. To prove the Riemann hypothesis for a certain class of invariant polynomials, we establish an analogue of the Enestrom-Kakeya theorem.",['Koji Chinen'],0,"['02d38c7d-3baf-40e3-86d7-a8884ff503f4', '078e6ac3-f385-42e2-a966-5ca05b98588a', 'b06b90e7-36f4-418a-82b2-656645469cf6', 'b86d2872-8125-4909-957a-d1e0f9cacb90']",An abundance of invariant polynomials satisfying the Riemann hypothesis,Discrete Mathematics,2008,4ab459ce-5f18-4cc0-9627-1dc557eb8b68
"Entity Resolution (ER) is the problem of identifying which records in a database refer to the same real-world entity. An exhaustive ER process involves computing the similarities between pairs of records, which can be very expensive for large datasets. Various blocking techniques can be used to enhance the performance of ER by dividing the records into blocks in multiple ways and only comparing records within the same block. However, most blocking techniques process blocks separately and do not exploit the results of other blocks. In this paper, we propose an  iterative blocking framework  where the ER results of blocks are reflected to subsequently processed blocks. Blocks are now iteratively processed until no block contains any more matching records. Compared to simple blocking, iterative blocking may achieve higher accuracy because reflecting the ER results of blocks to other blocks may generate additional record matches. Iterative blocking may also be more efficient because processing a block now saves the processing time for other blocks. We implement a scalable iterative blocking system and demonstrate that iterative blocking can be more accurate and efficient than blocking for large datasets.","['Steven Euijong Whang', 'David Menestrina', 'Georgia Koutrika', 'Martin Theobald', 'Hector Garcia-Molina']",211,"['0b5e0bfa-12ff-4175-9d65-d8cc62552ae6', '2cba753f-24b1-4b6c-8d36-b9bf66bd1477', '33d18bee-c873-4cf5-8962-e79a032cbdf3', '3960350c-fc91-4fae-83f3-69899d9c8a6f', '5d57c4fa-8dda-4e92-b42b-67f8d16f8602', '717f3af1-aa86-41db-90e5-bfb94ecf8616', '71e35609-693a-4036-9bac-861a7ce7c868', '76c1da70-2949-47c3-aefa-9d703c884cd3', '78001688-d865-4fda-a2eb-d5097c93bbb9', '866e99e1-f1d4-4be9-be12-1f3fe444fc52', '8cf0f572-0507-48cf-9ada-37c152f5810f', '99ac2c24-4d9a-4a96-a9a7-4ada6393677e', '9ff322c1-64c8-49e5-9c23-4b380eff5f10', 'b123d7d1-cced-41cc-a8fc-c710a8f8a736', 'b22383b0-6528-4156-9069-472d895438c3', 'b55b3100-5054-4d25-860d-d3e32fc56d14', 'c9b221ed-7083-4ae7-835c-8e8bd5af22ec', 'fb565ef1-0650-4e55-b68a-1936d8ddb188']",Entity resolution with iterative blocking,international conference on management of data,2009,4ab46288-3a29-471f-95c9-9926df1f93ce
